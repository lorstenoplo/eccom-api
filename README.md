# Ecommerce api

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

### An api created with amazing tech :
1. apollo 
2. express 
3. graphql 
4. mongodb 

This api is build on nodejs and written using typescript.

I use type-graphql to have strong typing for all my resolvers, queries and mutations.

## Why do I use all this instead of making a simple rest api ðŸ¤” 

- Graphql allows you get only the data you need by quering to just one endpoint
- Typescript allows us to have a strictly typed system 
- Mongodb is just my prefernce 

<hr />

As a side note this will be a open source api, meaning anyone can query data from this api if they would want to.
You can use this api for authenticating users, querieng product details ( for any eccomerce app )
